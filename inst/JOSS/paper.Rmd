## Summary

`checkr` is a lightweight (dependency-free) R package to check the values of common objects. 
In particular it can check the dimensions, classes, values, and names of scalars, vectors, lists and data frames.
The various functions provide informative errors (or warnings) that allow users to quickly identify and fix any problems.

It is intended to be used in scripts and in packages to check the values of arguments.
